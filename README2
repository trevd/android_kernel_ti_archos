android linux kernel 3.0.21 based on original archos sources found at 
http://gitorious.org/archos/archos-gpl-gen9-kernel-ics branch: linux-ics-3.0.21

Android boot mode awareness:
----------------------------
changes made to arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap4-reboot-reason.c to enable correct setting
of android system property ro.bootmode.

designed to be used in conjunction with roms created using device files locating in
https://github.com/trevd/android_device_ti_archos.git

Proc-v7.S changes
-----------------
I've backported arch/arm/mm/Proc-v7.S from the android-omap-3 kernel 3.4 branch, this
was done to allow the kernel to be built using the standard android toolchain.

Building
--------

Clone the android aosp toolchain
git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6

Using the Bourne Again Shell ( bash ) export an alias to make cross compiling easy

alias make-arm='<toolchain path>/arm-eabi-4.6/bin/:$PATH ARCH=arm SUBARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- LOCALVERSION_AUTO=n make'
make-arm distclean && make-arm mrproper
make-arm ti_archos_defconfig
make-arm -j$(grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo)

Out of tree drivers
-------------------
PowerVR Kernel Modules are not included in this release, they are available from omapzoom android aosp
repo located at git://git.omapzoom.org/device/ti/proprietary-open.git. this repo also contains the matching 
userland binary blobs, versions of which exist for Gingerbread, ICS and JellyBean. See device tree documentation
for further details ( https://github.com/trevd/android_device_ti_archos.git )
